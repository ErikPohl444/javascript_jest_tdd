# Javascript_jest_tdd

- Uses the fibonacci sequence as an excuse to do some TDD.
- Uses jest for test cases.
- Uses GitHub actions for a basic CI/CD pipeline, including Jest for test cases and Prettier for linting.
- I sometimes lead/manage and develop using TDD, but it is not my starting place with a team.
